They are not checklists for classroom visits. To knowledgeably fill out therubrics, principals need to have been in classrooms frequently throughout the year; it is irresponsible to fill out therubrics based on one classroom observation. Unannounced mini-observations every 2-3 week followed by face-to-faceconversations are the best way for principals to have an accurate sense of teachers’ performance, give formative praiseand suggestions, and listen to push-back."

Improvement Necessary indicates that performance has real deficiencies; itis not a “gentleman’s C” and nobody should be content to remain at this level.

This creates a clear graphic display of areas for commendation and areas that need work. Then give anoverall score for that domain at the bottom of the page (averaging the scores on the page) and make brief comments inthe space provided.

The principal has the final say, of course, but the discussion should aim for consensus based onactual evidence of the more accurate score for each criterion. Principals should go into the evaluation process with somehumility since they can’t possibly know everything about a teacher’s instructional activities, collegial interactions, parentoutreach, and professional growth. Similarly, teachers should be open to feedback from someone with an outsideperspective who has been in their classroom numerous times."
